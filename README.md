However, five examples they may suggest are (-1, 1), (-2, 2), (-3, 3), (-4, 4), and (-5, 5). Any pair of coordinates with a negative x-coordinate and a positive y-coordinate is correct, in other words, any pair of coordinates that describe a point in the upper-left quadrant.

Stars represent the organization’s best long-run opportunities for growth and profitability, having a high relative market share and a high industry growth rate. Cash Cows have a high relative market share position but compete in a low-growth industry. Dogs have a low relative market share position and compete in a slow- or no-market-growth industry.

Also, the size of each circle represents the percentage sales contribution of each division, and pie slices reveal the percentage profit contribution of each division in both the BCG and IE Matrix.

Elaborate on what these strategies could mean for a college or university.

Quadrant III strategies include retrenchment, diversification, divestiture, and liquidation.

However, students should mention that the college or university could possibly have to be closed. Faculty and/or staff might have to be greatly reduced, which could lead to unhappy students in very large classes.

The audit, compensation and nominating committees are made up solely of outside directors. Each director owns a large equity stake in the company. Each director attends at least 75 percent of all meetings. The board meets regularly without management present and evaluates its own performance annually. The CEO is not also the Chairperson of the Board. There are no interlocking directorships (where a director or CEO sits on another director’s board).
